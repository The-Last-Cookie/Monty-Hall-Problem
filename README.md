# The Monty Hall problem

In the Monty Hall quiz show, the participant gets presented 3 doors by the moderator. Only one of the doors _contains_ an extraordinary win like an expensive car or a big pile of money. The moderator opens one of the other two doors. As soon as the participant chooses one of the left doors, he can either switch and open the other door or open the door he originaly choose.

The paradox is now underlying in the probabillities the participant has. Many popular mathematicians suggested that the probability to win the money is 50% because there's only two doors left after the moderator opened the first door. But that assumption is wrong. If the participant doesn't switch the door, the probabillity is 1/3. Otherwise it is 2/3.
